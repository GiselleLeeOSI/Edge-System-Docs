# Edge System Logging

Logging is useful for diagnosing deployment or production issues, so it can set dynamically without restarting the system.

## Edge System Logging Configuration

Edge System and all loaded components provide the ability to configure logging per component.  An example logging configuration is given below.

```json
{
  "LogLevel": "Information",
  "LogFileSizeLimitBytes": 34636833,
  "LogFileCountLimit": 31
}
```
